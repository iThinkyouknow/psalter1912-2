Afar from Me, Thou dost not heed, Though day and night for help I plead. 2. But Thou art holy in Thy ways, Enthroned upon Thy people's praise; Our fathers put their trust in Thee, Believed, and Thou didst set them free. 3. They cried, and, trusting in Thy Name, Were saved, and were not put to shame. But in the dust My honor lies, While all reproach and all despise. 4. My words a cause for scorn they make, The lip they curl, the head they shake, And, mocking, bid me trust the Lord Till He salvation shall afford. 5. My trust on Thee I learned to rest When I was on My mother's breast; From birth Thou art my God alone, Thy care My life has ever known. 6. O let Thy strength and presence cheer, For trouble and distress are near; Be Thou not far away from Me, I have no source of help but Thee. 7. Unnumbered foes would do Me wrong, They press about Me, fierce and strong, Like beasts of prey their rage they vent, My courage fails, My strength is spent. 8. Down unto death Thou leadest Me, Consumed by thirst and agony; With cruel hate and anger fierce My helpless hands and feet they pierce. 9. While on My wasted form they stare, The garments torn from Me they share, My shame and sorrow heeding not, And for My robe they cast the lot. 10. O Lord, afar no longer stay; O Thou my helper, haste, I pray; From death and evil set Me free; I live, for Thou didst answer Me. 11. I live and will declare Thy fame Where brethren gather in Thy Name; Where all Thy faithful people meet, I will Thy worthy praise repeat.\nPsalm 22:1 Cited Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34 | Psalm 22:1 ver. 11 | Psalm 22:1 Psalm 32:3; 38:8; Job 3:24; Isaiah 59:11; [Hebrews 5:7] | Psalm 22:2 Psalm 88:1 | Psalm 22:3 Leviticus 19:2 | Psalm 22:3 [Psalm 80:1; 99:1] | Psalm 22:3 [Psalm 9:11, 14; 65:1; 102:21; 147:12] | Psalm 22:5 See Judges 3:9 | Psalm 22:5 Psalm 25:2; 31:1; 71:1; Isaiah 49:23; Romans 9:33 | Psalm 22:6 Job 25:6; Isaiah 41:14 | Psalm 22:6 Psalm 69:19; 109:25 | Psalm 22:6 Isaiah 49:7; 53:3 | Psalm 22:7 See Matthew 27:39-43; Mark 15:29-32; Luke 23:35, 36 | Psalm 22:7 Psalm 109:25; [Psalm 44:14; 2 Kings 19:21; Isaiah 37:22; Lamentations 2:15] | Psalm 22:8 [Psalm 37:5; Proverbs 16:3] | Psalm 22:8 Psalm 91:14 | Psalm 22:8 Psalm 18:19; Matthew 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22 | Psalm 22:9 Psalm 71:6 | Psalm 22:10 Isaiah 46:3; 49:1; Galatians 1:15 | Psalm 22:11 See ver. 1; Psalm 10:1 | Psalm 22:11 Psalm 107:12; 2 Kings 14:26; Isaiah 63:5 | Psalm 22:12 [Psalm 68:30 (Hebrews)] | Psalm 22:12 Amos 4:1 | Psalm 22:13 Psalm 35:21; Job 16:10; Lamentations 2:16; 3:46 | Psalm 22:14 [Lamentations 2:11] | Psalm 22:14 [Daniel 5:6] | Psalm 22:14 [Job 23:16; Nahum 2:10]; See Joshua 2:11 | Psalm 22:14 See Psalm 68:2 | Psalm 22:15 Proverbs 17:22 | Psalm 22:15 [John 19:28; See Job 29:10] | Psalm 22:16 [Philippians 3:2; Revelation 22:15] | Psalm 22:16 Psalm 88:17 | Psalm 22:16 Matthew 27:35; Mark 15:24; Luke 23:33; 24:40; John 19:23, 37; 20:25; [Zechariah 12:10] | Psalm 22:17 Luke 23:35 | Psalm 22:18 Cited John 19:24; [Matthew 27:35; Luke 23:34] | Psalm 22:19 [See ver. 11 above] | Psalm 22:19 Psalm 38:22 | Psalm 22:20 [Philippians 3:2; Revelation 22:15] | Psalm 22:21 2 Timothy 4:17 | Psalm 22:21 See Numbers 23:22 | Psalm 22:22 Cited Hebrews 2:12; [Psalm 102:21; John 17:6] | Psalm 22:22 Matthew 28:10; John 20:17; Romans 8:29 | Psalm 22:23 Psalm 135:20 | Psalm 22:23 Psalm 50:15, 23 | Psalm 22:24 [Isaiah 53:4, 7] | Psalm 22:24 Psalm 10:1; 13:1; See Job 13:24 | Psalm 22:24 Hebrews 5:7 | Psalm 22:25 Psalm 35:18; 40:9, 10; 111:1 | Psalm 22:25 Leviticus 7:16 | Psalm 22:25 Psalm 66:13; Jonah 2:9; See Psalm 50:14 | Psalm 22:26 Psalm 69:32 | Psalm 22:26 Isaiah 25:6; 65:13 | Psalm 22:26 John 6:51 | Psalm 22:27 Psalm 2:8; 67:7 | Psalm 22:27 Psalm 96:7 | Psalm 22:28 Obadiah 21; [Psalm 47:8; Zechariah 14:9] | Psalm 22:29 [Psalm 45:12] | Psalm 22:29 Psalm 72:9; [Philippians 2:10] | Psalm 22:29 Ezekiel 18:27 | Psalm 22:30 Psalm 48:13; 71:18 | Psalm 22:31 Psalm 86:9; [Isaiah 60:3] | Psalm 22:31 Psalm 78:6; 102:18"

Not sacrifice delights the Lord, But he who hears and keeps His word; Thou gavest me to hear Thy will, Thy law is in my heart; I come the Scripture to fulfill, Glad tidings to impart."

Upon the bed of suffering Jehovah will sustain, And in his sickness God will soothe The weariness and pain. 4. O Lord, to Thee my cry ascends, Let me Thy mercy see; Heal Thou my soul, for I have sinned, I have offended Thee. 5. My enemies against me speak, And they my life have scorned; They wish my name to pass away, Unhonored and unmourned. 6. My foe, deceitful, visits me, By seeming kindness led, His heart intent on gathering Some hurtful news to spread. 7. My foes, together whispering, Their evil plans devise; Disease, they say, cleaves fast to him, Laid low, he shall not rise. 8. Yea, he who was my chosen friend, In whom I put my trust, Who ate my bread, now turns in wrath To crush me in the dust. 9. Do Thou, Jehovah, show me grace, And raise me up again, That I with justice may requite These base and wicked men. 10. By this I know assuredly That I am loved by Thee, Because my foe does not exult In triumph over me. 11.

Though troubles surge, yet through the day The Lord His gracious help will give, And in the night my heart shall pray And sing to Him in Whom I live. 8. To God my Rock I cry and say, O why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning on my way, Oppressed by foes that know not Thee? 9.

Behold, in evil I was formed, And I was born in sin, But Thou wilt make me wise in heart, Thou seekest truth within. 3. From all pollution make me clean, Yea, whiter than the snow; O let my broken heart rejoice And gladness make me know; Blot out all my iniquities, And hide my sins from view; Create in me a spirit right, O God, my heart renew. 4.

Restore me Thy salvation's joy, My willing heart uphold; Then sinners shall be turned to Thee When I Thy ways unfold."

The wicked are prospered and firm in their strength, No pangs do they suffer, though death come at length; They are not in trouble as other men are, The plagues of their fellows they view from afar. 3. In garments of boasting and violence decked, With wealth more abundant than heart could expect, They scoff, and the helpless they proudly oppress, The heavens and the earth they assume to possess. 4. Despising God's people, they cause them to drain The cup of oppression, injustice, and pain; They question God's knowledge and boldly defy The might and the justice of God the Most High. 5. The wicked, grown wealthy, have comfort and peace, While I, daily chastened, see troubles increase, And, wronging God's children, I cried in my pain, That clean hearts are worthless and pure hearts are vain. 6. I went to God's temple: my doubts were dispelled, The end of life's journey I clearly beheld; I saw in what peril ungodly men stand With sudden destruction and ruin at hand. 7.

To God will I direct my prayer, And He will make my needs His care; I trust Him still, though in my grief No answer yet has brought relief; With hands stretched out through all the night, Uncomforted I sought for light. 2. The thought of God brought me no peace, But rather made my fears increase; With sleepless eyes and speechless pain My fainting spirit grieved in vain; The blessedness of long ago Made deeper still my present woe. 3. Recalling days when faith was bright, When songs of gladness filled my night, I pondered o'er my grievous woes And searching questioning arose: Will God cast off, and nevermore His favor to my soul restore? 4. I asked in fear and bitterness, Will God forsake me in distress? Shall I His promise faithless find? Has God forgotten to be kind? Has He in anger hopelessly Removed His love and grace from me? 5. These doubts and fears that troubled me Were born of my infirmity; Though I am weak, God is most high, And on His goodness I rely; Of all His wonders I will tell, And on His deeds my thoughts shall dwell."

My people, give ear, attend to my word, In parables new deep truths shall be heard; The wonderful story our fathers made known To children succeeding by us must be shown. 2. Instructing our sons we gladly record The praises, the works, the might of the Lord, For He hath commanded that what He hath done Be passed in tradition from father to son. 3. Let children thus learn from history's light To hope in our God and walk in His sight, The God of their fathers to fear and obey, And ne'er, like their fathers, to turn from His way. 4. The story be told, to warn and restrain, Of hearts that were hard, rebellious, and vain, Of soldiers who faltered when battle was near, Who kept not God's covenant nor walked in His fear. 5. God's wonderful works to them He had shown, His marvelous deeds their fathers had known; He made for their pathway the waters divide, His glorious pillar of cloud was their guide. 6. He gave them to drink, relieving their thirst, And forth from the rock caused water to burst; Yet faithless they tempted their God, and they said, Can He Who gave water supply us with bread? 7. Jehovah was wroth because they forgot To hope in their God, and trusted Him not; Yet gracious, He opened the doors of the sky And rained down the manna in richest supply. 8. With bread from on high their need He supplied, And more did He do when thankless they sighed; The strong winds commanding from south and from east, He sent them abundance of quail for their feast. 9. Though well they were filled, their folly they chose, Till God in His wrath o'erwhelmed them with woes; He slew of their strongest and smote their young men, But still unbelieving they sinned even then. 10. Because of their sin He smote with His rod, And then they returned and sought for their God; Their Rock and Redeemer was God the Most High, Yet false were their praises, their promise a lie. 11. Not right with their God in heart and in will, They faithlessly broke His covenant still; But He, in compassion, reluctant to slay, Forgave them and oft turned His anger away. 12. His pity was great, though often they sinned, For they were but flesh, a swift passing wind; Yet though His compassion and grace they beheld, They tempted and grieved Him and often rebelled. 13. They limited God, the Most Holy One, And hindered the work His grace had begun; The hand that was mighty to save they forgot, The day of redemption remembering not. 14. Ungrateful and blind, no longer they thought Of wonders and signs and mighty deeds wrought, Of how all the rivers of Egypt ran red, And plagues in God's anger were heaped on their head. 15. They thought not of how, their freedom to gain, In Egypt's abodes the first-born were slain, And how all God's people were led forth like sheep, The flock He delighted in safety to keep.\nPsalm 78:1 [Isaiah 51:4]; See Psalm 49:1; 50:7 | Psalm 78:2 Cited Matthew 13:35; See Psalm 49:4 | Psalm 78:2 [Numbers 21:27] | Psalm 78:3 See Psalm 44:1 | Psalm 78:4 Job 15:18 | Psalm 78:4 [Exodus 12:26, 27; 13:8, 14; Deuteronomy 11:19; Joshua 4:6, 7; Joel 1:3] | Psalm 78:4 ver. 11, 32 | Psalm 78:5 Psalm 19:7; [Psalm 81:5] | Psalm 78:5 Psalm 147:19 | Psalm 78:5 Psalm 147:19 | Psalm 78:6 ver. 4; Psalm 102:18 | Psalm 78:7 Psalm 77:12 | Psalm 78:7 Psalm 105:45 | Psalm 78:8 2 Kings 17:14; 2 Chronicles 30:7; Ezekiel 20:18 | Psalm 78:8 Exodus 32:9; 33:3; Deuteronomy 9:7, 24; 31:27; Jeremiah 5:23 | Psalm 78:8 ver. 37; Job 11:13 | Psalm 78:9 ver. 57 | Psalm 78:10 [2 Kings 17:15] | Psalm 78:11 See Psalm 106:13 | Psalm 78:11 ver. 4 | Psalm 78:12 ver. 43; See Exodus 7-12; Psalm 72:18 | Psalm 78:12 ver. 43; Numbers 13:22; Isaiah 19:11, 13; Ezekiel 30:14 | Psalm 78:13 Psalm 136:13; Exodus 14:21 | Psalm 78:13 Exodus 15:8 | Psalm 78:14 See Psalm 105:39 | Psalm 78:15 ver. 20; Psalm 105:41; 114:8; Exodus 17:6; Isaiah 48:21 | Psalm 78:16 Numbers 20:8, 10, 11 | Psalm 78:17 ver. 40, 56; Deuteronomy 9:22; Isaiah 63:10 | Psalm 78:18 ver. 41, 56; Psalm 95:9; 106:14; Deuteronomy 6:16; 1 Corinthians 10:9 | Psalm 78:19 [Exodus 16:3; Numbers 11:4; 20:3; 21:5] | Psalm 78:19 See Psalm 23:5 | Psalm 78:20 ver. 15, 16 | Psalm 78:21 Numbers 11:1 | Psalm 78:22 ver. 8, 32, 37 | Psalm 78:23 Genesis 7:11; [Malachi 3:10] | Psalm 78:24 Exodus 16:4 | Psalm 78:24 Psalm 105:40; [John 6:31] | Psalm 78:25 Psalm 103:20 | Psalm 78:25 [ver. 29] | Psalm 78:26 Numbers 11:31 | Psalm 78:27 [Genesis 13:16] | Psalm 78:27 [Genesis 22:17] | Psalm 78:28 Exodus 16:13; Numbers 11:31 | Psalm 78:29 Numbers 11:19, 20 | Psalm 78:29 Numbers 11:4, 34 | Psalm 78:30 Numbers 11:33; [Job 20:23] | Psalm 78:31 Isaiah 10:16 | Psalm 78:31 ver. 63 | Psalm 78:32 See Numbers 14; 16; 17 | Psalm 78:32 ver. 22; Numbers 14:11 | Psalm 78:33 Numbers 14:29, 35; 26:64, 65 | Psalm 78:33 Psalm 39:5 | Psalm 78:34 Hosea. 5:15 | Psalm 78:35 Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 31 | Psalm 78:35 Exodus 15:13; See Psalm 74:2 | Psalm 78:36 Isaiah 29:13; Ezekiel 33:31 | Psalm 78:36 Isaiah 57:11 | Psalm 78:37 ver. 8 | Psalm 78:37 Psalm 51:10 | Psalm 78:38 Exodus 34:6 | Psalm 78:38 Numbers 14:20 | Psalm 78:39 [Psalm 103:14; Job 10:9] | Psalm 78:39 Genesis 6:3 | Psalm 78:39 Job 7:7 | Psalm 78:40 ver. 17, 56; Psalm 107:11 | Psalm 78:40 [Ephesians 4:30] | Psalm 78:40 Psalm 106:14 | Psalm 78:41 See ver. 18 | Psalm 78:41 See Psalm 71:22 | Psalm 78:42 Judges 8:34 | Psalm 78:43 For ver. 43-51, see Psalm 105:27-36 | Psalm 78:43 Exodus 7:3; [Psalm 106:22]; Acts 7:36 | Psalm 78:43 Exodus 4:21; 11:9, 10 | Psalm 78:43 See ver. 12 | Psalm 78:44 See Exodus 7:17-24 | Psalm 78:45 See Exodus 8:21-24 | Psalm 78:45 See Exodus 8:2-14 | Psalm 78:46 See Exodus 10:12-15 | Psalm 78:47 See Exodus 9:23-25 | Psalm 78:48 See Exodus 9:19-21 | Psalm 78:49 Exodus 12:13, 23; [2 Samuel 24:16] | Psalm 78:51 Exodus 12:29; [Psalm 105:36; 135:8; 136:10] | Psalm 78:51 Psalm 105:23, 27; 106:22 | Psalm 78:52 See Psalm 77:20 | Psalm 78:53 [Exodus 14:19, 20] | Psalm 78:53 [Exodus 14:13] | Psalm 78:53 Exodus 14:27, 28; 15:10 | Psalm 78:54 Exodus 15:17 | Psalm 78:54 Isaiah 11:9; 57:13; [Psalm 68:16] | Psalm 78:54 Psalm 74:2 | Psalm 78:55 See Psalm 44:2 | Psalm 78:55 Joshua 23:4; [Psalm 135:12; 136:21, 22; Acts 13:19] | Psalm 78:56 ver. 18; Judges 2:11, 12 | Psalm 78:56 ver. 40 | Psalm 78:57 Hosea. 7:16; [ver. 9] | Psalm 78:58 Deuteronomy 31:29 | Psalm 78:58 Leviticus 26:30; Deuteronomy 12:2; 1 Kings 11:7; 12:31; Ezekiel 20:28 | Psalm 78:58 Numbers 25:11; Deuteronomy 32:16, 21; Judges 2:12 | Psalm 78:58 Deuteronomy 7:5, 25; 12:3 | Psalm 78:59 ver. 62; Psalm 106:40; Deuteronomy 3:26 | Psalm 78:60 1 Samuel 4:11; Jeremiah 7:12, 14; 26:6 | Psalm 78:60 Joshua 18:1 | Psalm 78:61 Psalm 132:8; [Psalm 63:2; 96:6] | Psalm 78:61 [1 Samuel 4:21] | Psalm 78:62 [1 Samuel 4:10] | Psalm 78:62 ver. 59 | Psalm 78:63 [Psalm 79:5; 89:46] | Psalm 78:63 [Jeremiah 7:34] | Psalm 78:64 1 Samuel 4:11 | Psalm 78:64 Job 27:15 | Psalm 78:65 Psalm 73:20; See Psalm 35:23 | Psalm 78:66 [Psalm 40:14] | Psalm 78:67 Psalm 80:1; 81:5 | Psalm 78:68 Psalm 87:2 | Psalm 78:69 See 1 Kings 6 | Psalm 78:70 1 Samuel 16:12, 13 | Psalm 78:71 2 Samuel 7:8 | Psalm 78:71 2 Samuel 5:2; [Psalm 28:9] | Psalm 78:71 1 Samuel 10:1 | Psalm 78:72 Psalm 101:2; 1 Kings 9:4 | Psalm 78:72 [Psalm 77:20]"

Again they rebelled and tempted the Lord, Unfaithful they turned to idols abhorred, And God in His anger withdrew from them then, No longer delighting to dwell among men. 5. He gave them to death in battle, although His glory and strength were scorned by the foe; Their young men were fallen, their maidens unwed, Their priests slain in battle, none wept for the dead. 6. Then mercy awoke, the Lord in His might Returned, and the foes were scattered in flight; Again to His people His favor He showed, And chose in Mount Zion to fix His abode. 7.

Great Shepherd Who leadest Thy people in love, 'Mid cherubim dwelling, shine Thou from above; In might come and save us, Thy people restore, And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more. 2. O haste, Lord, to hear us and pity our woes, Affliction our portion, despised by our foes; O Lord, God Almighty, in mercy restore, And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more. 3. A place for Thy people Thou, Lord, didst prepare, Thy vine deeply rooted rewarded Thy care; Its branches like cedars, majestic and free, Spread over the mountains from river to sea. 4. Thy vineyard no longer Thy tender care knows, Defenseless, the victim and spoil of her foes; O turn, we beseech Thee, all glory is Thine, Look down in Thy mercy and visit Thy vine. 5. The branch of Thy planting is burned and cut down, Brought nigh to destruction because of Thy frown; The man of Thy right hand with wisdom endue, The son of man strengthen Thy pleasure to do. 6. When Thou shalt revive us Thy Name we will praise, And nevermore, turning, depart from Thy ways; O Lord God almighty, in mercy restore, And we shall be saved when Thy face shines once more."

Now to God, our Strength and Saviour, Render praise and loudly sing; In our fathers' God rejoicing, All your noblest music bring. 2. Let the trumpet, far resounding, This our festal day proclaim, By our fathers' God appointed, When from bondage Israel came. 3. I, Thy God, removed thy burdens, When thou calledst, set Thee free, Proved thee in the thirsty desert, In the thunder answered thee. 4. O My people, hear My pleadings; O that thou wouldst hearken now; No strange worship shalt thou offer, Nor to idols shalt thou bow. 5. I am God the Lord Who saved thee, And from cruel bondage freed; Open wide thy mouth of longing; I will satisfy thy need. 6. But My people would not hearken, Yea, they would not yield to Me; So I left them in their blindness, Their own counselors to be. 7. If my people would obey Me, Gladly walking in My ways, Soon would I, their foes subduing, Fill their lips with songs of praise. 8.

Let me live to tell Thy praises, By Thy lovingkindness led. 4. Still, O Lord, renewed each morning Unto Thee my prayer shall be; Cast me not away forever, Let me now Thy favor see.

O Lord, with joy my heart expands Before the wonders of Thy hands; Great works, Jehovah, Thou hast wrought, Exceeding deep Thy every thought; A foolish man knows not their worth, Nor he whose mind is of the earth. 3. When as the grass the wicked grow, When sinners flourish here below, Then is there endless ruin nigh, But Thou, O Lord, art throned on high; Thy foes shall fall before Thy might, The wicked shall be put to flight. 4. Thou, Lord, hast high exalted ma With royal strength and dignity; With Thy anointing I am blest, Thy grace and favor on me rest; I thus exult o'er all my foes, O'er all that would my cause oppose. 5. The righteous man shall flourish well, And in the house of God shall dwell; He shall be like a goodly tree, And all his life shall fruitful be; For righteous is the Lord and just, He is my Rock, in Him I trust.\nPsalm 92:1 Psalm 147:1; [Psalm 71:22] | Psalm 92:1 [Genesis 14:19, 20] | Psalm 92:2 See Psalm 36:5 | Psalm 92:2 [Psalm 119:147, 148] | Psalm 92:2 See Psalm 36:5 | Psalm 92:2 [Psalm 119:147, 148] | Psalm 92:3 See Psalm 33:2 | Psalm 92:3 See Psalm 33:2 | Psalm 92:3 See Psalm 33:2 | Psalm 92:4 See Psalm 90:16 | Psalm 92:4 Psalm 8:6 | Psalm 92:5 Psalm 111:2; Revelation 15:3 | Psalm 92:5 Psalm 40:5; 139:17 | Psalm 92:5 [Romans 11:33]; See Psalm 36:6 | Psalm 92:7 See Job 21:7 | Psalm 92:7 Psalm 94:4; 125:5 | Psalm 92:8 Psalm 93:4 | Psalm 92:9 See Psalm 68:1 | Psalm 92:10 See Psalm 75:10; 1 Samuel 2:1 | Psalm 92:10 Numbers 23:22 | Psalm 92:10 See Psalm 23:5 | Psalm 92:11 See Psalm 37:34; 54:7 | Psalm 92:12 Psalm 1:3; 52:8; 72:7; Proverbs 11:28; [Numbers 24:6; Isaiah 61:3]; See Hosea. 14:5-8 | Psalm 92:13 Psalm 100:4; 116:19; 135:2 | Psalm 92:15 [Psalm 58:11] | Psalm 92:15 See Psalm 18:2 | Psalm 92:15 See Job 34:10"

He rides on the clouds, the wings of the storm, The lightening and wind His mission perform; The earth He has founded her station to keep, And wrapped as a vesture about her the deep. 3. O'er mountain and plain the dark waters raged; His voice they obeyed, the floods were assuaged; Uplifting the mountains He ordered a bound, Forbidding the waters to cover the ground. 4.

The Lord makes the night, when, leaving the lair, The lions creep forth, God's bounty to share; The Lord makes the morning, when beasts steal away And men are beginning the work of the day. 5. How many and wise Thy works are, O Lord! The earth with the wealth of wisdom is stored, The sea bears in safety the ships to and fro, And creatures unnumbered it shelters below. 6.

Let hearts rejoice that seek the Lord, His holy Name adore; Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek Him for evermore. 3. Ye children of God's covenant, Who of His grace have heard, Forget not all His wondrous deeds And judgments of His word. 4. The Lord our God is God alone, All lands His judgments know; His promise He remembers still, While generations go. 5. While yet our fathers were but few, Sojourners in the land, He sware that Canaan should be theirs, And made His covenant stand. 6. He suffered none to do them wrong In all their pilgrim way; Yea, for their sake were kings reproved And covered with dismay. 7. His stern command restrained their foes And filled them with alarm: Touch not My own anointed ones, Nor do my prophets harm. 8. He wholly broke the staff of bread And called for famine sore, And He prepared His people's way By sending one before. 9.

He led them forth in health and strength, None weak in all their band, And Egypt, filled with fear, rejoiced To see them leave the land. 16. He spread a cloud to cover them, Most glorious and bright, And made a fiery pillar shine To give them light by night. 17. At their request He sent them quails, And bread of heaven bestowed; And from the rock, to quench their thirst, The living waters flowed. 18.

I am sore distressed and lonely; Waves of trouble o'er me roll. Myriad woes beset my heart, Myriad doubts and bitternesses; Thou who my Deliverer art, Bring me out of my distresses. 9. O consider my affliction, All my travail, Lord, behold; Grant me full and free remission Of my trespasses untold. See mine enemies; for great Is the number that upbraid me; Who, in their consuming hate, With their cruel scorn have flayed me. 10. Keep my soul, O gracious Savior; Come, I pray, deliver me, Lest my head with shame be covered, For my refuge is in Thee. Trusting in Thy power supreme, Lord, I wait for Thy salvation; Come, Jehovah, and redeem Israel from tribulation."

Yea, athirst for Thee I cry; God of life, O when shall I Come again to stand before Thee In Thy temple, and adore Thee? 2. Bitter tears of lamentation Are my food by night and day; In my deep humiliation Where is now thy God? they say.

Hope in God, thy faith retrieving; Let Him still thy refuge be. I shall yet extol His grace For the comfort of His face; He has ever turned my sorrow Into gladness on the morrow. 4. From the land beyond the Jordan I bewail my misery; From the foothills of Mount Hermon, O my God, I think of Thee. As the waters plunge and leap, Deep re-echoes unto deep; All Thy waves and billows roaring O'er my troubled soul are pouring. 5. But the Lord will send salvation, And by day His love provide; He shall be my exultation, And my song at eventide. On His praise e'en in the night I will ponder with delight, And in prayer, transcending distance, Seek the God of my existence. 6. I will say to God, my fortress: Why hast Thou forsaken me? Why go I about in sadness For my foes' dread tyranny? Their rebukes and scoffing words Pierce my bones as pointed sword, As they say with proud defiance: Where is God, thy soul's reliance? 7. O my soul, why art thou grieving; Why disquieted in me? Hope in God, thy faith retrieving; He will still thy refuge be. I shall yet through all my days Give to Him my thankful praise; God, who will from shame deliver, Is my God, my rock, forever."

The heavens praise, O Lord, Thy wonders day and night; Thy saints on earth extol Thy faithfulness and might; Exultingly they ask: \"Who, Lord, within Thy dwelling, Who of the kings of earth, in carnal strength excelling, Can be compared with Thee, Jehovah great and glorious, In all Thy wise designs triumphant and victorious?\" 4.

We lift our heads aloft, for God, our shield, is o'er us; Through Him, through Him alone, whose presence goes before us, We'll wear the victor's crown, no more by foes assaulted, We'll triumph through our King, by Israel's God exalted. 7. As long as heaven stands on pillars firm and sure, So long shall David's seed through endless years endure. But if his children e'er forsake My law appointed, And walk not in the ways decreed by Mine Anointed, Then truly will I come in holy indignation, And chastise them with rods for all their provocation. 8. Remember, Lord, how frail I am, how few my years; My life is like a cloud that comes and disappears; Has man, then, lived in vain? Who can, in death's dark hour, Escape the dismal grave with all its ruinous power? O Lord, recall Thy love, Thy words to David spoken, Sustain us as of yore by covenant-oaths unbroken."

God who rules in state Is in Zion great, He excels in worth All that dwell on earth. Honor and acclaim His exalted Name, All ye high and lowly, He alone is holy. 3. For God's royal might Serves His truth and right, Justice He maintains, Righteously He reigns. Manifesting grace To His chosen race, Jacob's seed He'll never From His covenant sever. 4. Then let all accord Honor to the Lord, At His footstool bow, Seek His favor now Worship and acclaim His exalted Name, All ye high and lowly; God alone is holy."
