In its simplest form the creed probably originated in the early part of the second century and arose in connection with the instruction of catechumens in preparation for baptism. In its present form this creed is probably of no earlier date than the latter part of the fifth century. It is the best known of the ecumenical creeds; and it  gives simple, brief, and yet full expression to our \"catholic, undoubted Christian faith.\""
